<h1>Fast NIR Polarization Differential Imaging</h1> 

<p>High-speed polarization differential imaging is achieved by way of synchronizing a high frame rate <a href="https://www.first-light-imaging.com/product/c-red-one/">C-RED ONE</a> camera with polarization modulation.</p>

<p> Key elements of the NIR fast-PDI mode are:
<ul>
<li>Half-waveplate (HWP) for slow modulation</li>
<li>Field stop</li>
<li>Ferro-electric Liquid Crystal (FLC) modulator</li>
<li>Wollaston prism</li>
<li>High speed NIR camera</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Much of the optical train is shared with the CHARIS-PDI mode. The Wollaston prism is a duplicate of the CHARIS-PDI Wollaston.</p>

<p>Two modes are offered:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mode #1: Double-differential imaging</b>. In this mode, we use the HWP for slow modulation, the field stop and the Wollaston prism. </li>
<li><b>Mode #2: Triple-differential imaging</b>. In this mode, we add the FLC modulator, synchronized with the camera acquisition.
</li>

<h2>Preliminary contrast curves</h2>


<p>Contrast curves were calculated on two targets observe during engineering nights with excellent seeing conditions (~0.4''): the unpolarized standard star psi01 Aqr, and the polarization target R Aqr.</p>

<p>A raw contrast curve was calculated using only one minute of data on the unpolarized standard star psi01 Aqr, showing that we achieve ~1e-4 raw contrast at ~0.15 arcsec separations, before double-differential processing. The contrast for stokes Q and U were also calculated, showing that we achieve a contrast of a few 1e-6 at 0.15 arcsec with double-differential processing (mode #1, H-band). The addition of a third differential processing (mode #2) should improve this further.</p>

	<br></center>

<p>We also produced contrast curves using  the non-coronagraphic and coronagraphic images of R Aqr (one minute datasets). The raw contrast is similar in this case without coronagraphic mask, and goes down significantly with the coronagraph, especially at small separations. The green curve was obtained by subtracting two datasets ~5 minutes apart. It shows that the contrast stability over a short timescale is on the order of 1e-6.</p>
