<p>MEC, the MKID Exoplanet Camera, is an ultra-fast energy-resolving camera designed for high contrast imaging in the near-infrared band. It was developed in collaboration with Ben Mazin and Alex Walter among others at the <a href="mazinlab.org">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. With 20,160 pixels, MEC has the largest superconducting dector array in the world and can distinguish the colors of individual photons at microsecond resolutions. MEC arrived on Mauna Kea, HI in March 2018 and it is currently undergoing commissioning and testing at the Subaru Telescope behind SCExAO.</p>

<p>MEC uses an emerging superconducting detector technology called Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKID) and operates at a temperature of 90 milliKelvin. Unlike conventional semi-conductor technology, MKIDs generate tens of thousands of free electrons when a photon breaks Cooper pairs in the superconducting circuit. This sensitivity is what allows the energy-resolved and noise-free detection of photon events. The custom readout electronics provide a continuous stream of photon arrival times to a computer essentially providing frames of arbitrarily short exposure time on demand.</p>

<p>MEC's purpose is to find and characterize directly imaged exoplanets in J,y,z band. In post-processing, the energy resolution R~8 allows for spectral differential imaging (SDI) and the extraordinary speed allows stochastic speckle discrimination (SSD), a promising speckle removal technique using the photon arrival time statistics to distinguish between speckles and companions. Most importantly, the fast noise-free continuous readout of the MKIDs allows for focal plane speckle control at rates high enough to track speckles with ~1s lifetimes, removing the current dominant noise-source in direct imaging experiments. </p>

<h1>Background, Additional Information</h1>

<p>
	The MKIDS camera is being developed in collaboration with a team from the <a href="http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~bmazin/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. It is led by Ben Mazin and includes Seth Meeker, Matt Strader, Julian van Eyken and others at UCSB, Rebecca Jensen-Clem at Caltech, and Bruce Bumble at JPL.
	</p>
	<p>
	The MKIDS acronym stands for Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors which are an emerging superconducting detector technology capable of noise-free single-photon-counting and low-resolution spectrophotometry across UV, optical, and near-IR wavelengths simultaneously. MKIDs have great potential as integral field units for high-contrast imaging experiments because they are capable of generating noise-free data cubes with arbitrarily short exposures. This allows speckle-reduction post-processing by Chromatic Differential Imaging and by the Dark Speckle technique, a promising speckle removal technique that has previously been limited by the absence of a suitable detector technology. Most importantly, the fast and continuous readout of MKIDs allows for focal plane speckle control at rates high enough to track speckles with ~1s lifetimes, removing the current dominant noise-source in direct imaging experiments.

	<p>
	The first UVOIR MKID camera, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry (ARCONS), saw first light at Palomar Observatory in 2011 and has since demonstrated the first science results from any MKID camera. The MKID camera for SCExAO will feature an upgraded detector array, with 5x as many pixels as ARCONS, optimized for a target bandwidth of 0.7-1.4 microns, and an overhauled readout system integrated directly with the wavefront control for extremely fast focal-plane feedback.
