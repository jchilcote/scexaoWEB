<h1> Science modules under development</h1>

<p>These modules will provide additional science science capabilities. They are available for engineering observations and undergoing commissionning, but not yet offered for regular open use observations.</p>

<p>If you would like to use these new capabilities for science or engineering, please contact us to join the corresponding development/commissionning team(s).</p>




<h2>MKID Exoplanet Camera (MEC)</h2>

<a href="./010mkids.web/indexm.html">MEC</a> is a fast photon-counting, wavelength-resolving camera developed by UCSB. It serves both as a focal plane wavefront sensor and a science instrument.

<h2>FIRST</h2>

<a href="./020first.web/indexm.html">FIRST</a> is a visible light fiber-fed interferometer for stellar physics. It provides ultra-high angular resolution to map the surface of stars and identify tight companions.

<h2>RHEA</h2>
<a href="./030rhea.web/indexm.html">RHEA</a> is a small-field-of-view, high spectral resolution integral field spectrograph for stellar physics. 


<h2>GLINT</h2>
<a href="./040glint.web/indexm.html">GLINT</a> is a near-IR fiber-fed photonic nuller interferometer, optimized to observe warm dust around stars.
	
<h2>SCExAO-fed IRD</h2>
<a href="./050ird.web/indexm.html">SCExAO-IRD</a> injects light in a single-mode fiber to feed the IRD near-IR high-resolution spectrograph.

<h1> Visiting modules</h1>

<p>We are currently hosting two visiting cameras. The visiting instruments are managed by our collaborators - please contact them if you would like to get involved.</p>

<h2>KERNEL team CRED-One</h2>

A CRED-one camera is installed behind SCExAO as part of a collaboration with the Kernel team led by Dr. Frantz Martinache.


<h2>University of Hawaii SAPHIRA</h2>
	
A SAPHIRA-based nearIR camera is installed behind SCExAO as part of a collaboration with the University of Hawaii (POC: Don Hall).
