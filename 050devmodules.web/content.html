<h1> Science modules under development</h1>

<p>These modules will provide additional science science capabilities. They are available for engineering observations and undergoing commissionning, but not yet offered for regular open use observations.</p>

<p>If you would like to use these new capabilities for science or engineering, please contact us to join the corresponding development/commissionning team(s).</p>



<h2>FIRST</h2>

<a href="./020first.web/indexm.html">FIRST</a> is a visible light fiber-fed interferometer for stellar physics. It provides ultra-high angular resolution to map the surface of stars and identify tight companions.

<h2>RHEA</h2>
<a href="./030rhea.web/indexm.html">RHEA</a> is a small-field-of-view, high spectral resolution integral field spectrograph for stellar physics. 


<h2>GLINT</h2>
<a href="./040glint.web/indexm.html">GLINT</a> is a near-IR fiber-fed photonic nuller interferometer, optimized to observe warm dust around stars.
