<h2>VAMPIRES instrument description</h2>
  <p>
  The Visible Aperture Masking Polarimetric Interferometer for Resolving Exoplanetary Signatures (VAMPIRES) instrument draws on the established success of sparse aperture masking interferometry (also known as non-redundant masking) and combines it with differential polarimetry, to provide diffraction limited scattered-light imaging of circumstellar environments. Primary science targets include protoplanetary disks as well as the mass-loss shells of evolved stars. It is being developed in collaboration with a team from the University of Sydney, Australia, consisting of Peter Tuthill, Barnaby Norris, Guillaume Schworer and Paul Stewart.
  </p>
  <p>
  Sparse aperture masking (SAM) allows the full diffraction limit of the telescope to be recovered by using selected sub-pupils of the telescope pupil as interferometer baselines. See, for example, Tuthill, et al. (2000), PASP, 112, 555; Huelamo, et al., (2011), A&A, 528, L7; Kraus & Ireland, (2012), ApJ, 745, 5. The addition of differential polarimetry allows SAM’s differential observables to be far more precisely calibrated, while providing polarization information of the target.
  </p>
  <p>
  In a technique complementary to infrared coronagraphy, VAMPIRES provides an effective inner-working-angle at 600 to 800 nm of ~10 mas, depending on the contrast ratio. A comprehensive description of the instrument is given in Norris, et al. (2015), MNRAS, 447, 3. The science potential of VAMPIRES’ core technique - differential polarimetric spare aperture masking - is demonstrated in Norris, et al., (2012), Nature, 484, 220.
  </p>
  <p>
  An instrument schematic is given below. Three tiers of differential calibration allow interferometric visibilities to be calibrated to 0.1%, and closure phases to better than a degree. In its primary mode (with masks and the polarimeter), VAMPIRES offers spatial resolution at the diffraction limit (<10 mas), while having a relatively small field-of-view — around ~500 mas — as defined by the shortest baseline. The sensitivity of VAMPIRES observations in the primary mode is determined by the contrast ratio between the unresolved stellar flux and the overall scattered-light flux from the circumstellar dust. As a guide, a star:disk contrast ratio of 1000:1 provides a 1 sigma detection on a single baseline. Depending on the aperture mask employed, typically hundreds or even thousands of baselines (in the case of the annular mask) are measured.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition to the primary differential-polarized SAM mode, VAMPIRES also offers several additional modes: conventional masking mode (non-polarized) and a polarized imaging mode (full pupil, no masks).
  <p>
  VAMPIRES can operate simultaneously with SCExAO/HiCIAO NIR observations. While wavelengths > 1μm are sent to SCExAO’s IR channel and HiCIAO, shorter wavelengths are sent to the SCExAO visible channel (including the pyramid WFS) and VAMPIRES.
  </p>

  The data product produced by VAMPIRES is a set of differential interferometric Visibilities and Closure Phases. The team at the University of Sydney provide expertise in interpretation of these data, including model-fitting. An example data set is shown in the figure below.
