<h2>Active team members</h2>

<table border=1 cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">

<tr>
<td><font face="Trebuchet MS"> <a href="http://frantzmartinache.eu/"><b><i>Dr Frantz Martinache</i></b></a> is a founding member of the SCExAO project. Currently he holds a position as a assistant professor at Laboratoire Lagrange Observatoire de la Côte d’AzurFrantz. He was responsible for the design and construction of the first few generations of SCExAO. He pioneered the electrical/signal distribution system for the instrument and wrote the control software to automate the various functions of the instrument. His greatest contribution however, is the development of the speckle nulling routine which promises and order of magnitude reduction on the brightness of the qausi-static speckles around the post coronagraphic PSF. He is currently implementing his focal plane wavefront sensing method which relies on kernel phase analysis to the instrument. </font></td>

<tr>
<td><font face="Trebuchet MS"> <b><i>Dr Nemanja Jovanovic</i></b> is a key member of the SCExAO team. Currently he holds a position as a Senior Instrument Scientist at Caltech Optical Observatories, California Institute of Technology. He was responsible for the design and successful 2013 and 2016 SCExAO instrument rebuilds, which included upgrading to the 2000 element deformable mirror and reflective rather than refractive relay optics (2013), and simultaneous feed of feed CHARIS, MEC, SAPHIRA and GLINT (2016). He demonstrated the efficient injection of star light from an ExAO system to a single mode fiber and the subsequent use of a photonic spectrograph to characterize the target

<tr>
<td><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><i>Christophe Clergeon</i></b> was involved in many rebuilds and upgrades of SCExAO throughout his PhD. His project focused on the design, build and early implementation of the non-modulated pyramid wavefront sensor for high-order wavefront correction on SCExAO. Christophe demonstrated the closed-loop operation of the wavefront sensor for the first 10 Zernike modes and 900 Fourier modes in the laboratory. Christophe is currently involved in the upgrade of AO188, which will benefit the SCExAO operations in near future.</font></td>

<h2>Visiting members</h2>


<ul>
<li>
Dr Jun-Ichi Morino is a frequent visitor and contributor to the SCExAO project. He has been contributing to the project since ~2010. Most recently Jun-Ichi helped develop low and high level software algorithms for the December 2013 observing run.

<ul>

<li>Sean Goebel, started in October 2014 and obtained his PhD in July 2018 with the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii. He worked on using photon counting IR detectors for advanced wavefront control. Sean is working with the Selex, SAPHIRA detector and laying the ground work for the MKIDS array to arrive from UCSB. He spent half his time at Subaru Telescope and the rest at the IfA.</li><br>

<li>Nour Skaf, from Institut d'Optique (Paris), worked in 2018 on wavefront control software for both SCExAO and AO188.</li><br>

<li>Garima Singh, currently working at LESIA's <a href="http://thd-bench.lesia.obspm.fr/team-10/">high contrast imaging group</a> in the Observatoire de Paris, was a PhD student in the SCExAO team (2012-2015). She implemented on the Low-Order Wavefront Sensor (LOWFS), a critical part of SCExAO's wavefront control architecture, and obtained her PhD in Sept 2015. Garima continues to collaborate with the SCExAO team on wavefront control and coronagraphy issues.</li>

<li>Vincent Garrel, student at Observatoire de Paris (France), completed his PhD within the SCExAO team in 2012.

Vincent was also part of the Subaru AO team and lead the crew of spotters for LGS AO runs.</li><br>

<li>Sebastien Vievard, an undergraduate student from Observatoire de Paris worked with the SCExAO team on a 6 month internship over the summer of 2013. Sebastien was influential in getting the FIRST instrument setup at Subaru and interfaced with SCExAO. He lead the alignment and testing of that module during his time.</li><br>
				
<li>Nicolas Parot, an undergraduate student visited us for a 3 month internship in the summer of 2013. He looked into appropriate disk targets for SCExAO and helped with the rebuild.</li><br>

<li>Tyler Groff, visited the SCExAO group several times during his PhD to help with the design and assembly of the early version of the instrument. He was critical to early observing runs and is the PI of a shaped pupil coronagraph currently installed within SCExAO. He worked on the SCExAO instrument throughout 2009-2012 and is now an on-going collaborator via the CHARIS integral field spectrograph project.</li><br>

<li>Paul Stewart, a graduate student from the University of Sydney visited the SCExAO team in 2011 and 2012. He worked on implementing the dual level (visible and IR) benches in SCExAO for the first time. He is currently involved with the visitor module VAMPIRES.</li><br>

<li>Takashi Yoshikawa, graduate student at the University of Tokyo (Japan), worked with the SCExAO group over the winter of 2009/2010. Takashi majored in space engineering and his focus was on attitude determination and control of spacecrafts. He contributed to the micro-satellite projects PRISM and Nano-JASMINE. During his stay he learnt about AO techniques and in particular phase diversity, to apply some of the tricks to space telescopes.</li><br>

<li>Kaito Yokochi, graduate student at the University of Tokyo (Japan), also visited over the winter of 2009/2010, to learn about the PIAA and help with the integration of an early version of SCExAO. His experience in interferometry and wavefront sensing techniques made him a great asset to our team. Kaito also explores ways to implement other coronagraphs like the 8OPM and UNI-PAC to SCExAO.</li><br>

<li>Frederic Vogt from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (Switzerland)  worked with the SCExAO team in 2009 on the design and implementation of the Coronagraphic Low-Order Wavefront Sensor.</li><br>

<li>Gaetano Sivo, Master's student from Universite de Paris-Sud XI, contributed to the opto-mechanical design of the SCExAO bench and set up an alignment procedure for the different elements of the coronagraph in 2009.</li><br>
