				  <td><font face="Trebuchet MS"> <a href="http://frantzmartinache.eu/"><b><i>Dr Frantz Martinache</i></b></a> is a founding member of the SCExAO project. Currently he holds a position as a assistant professor at Laboratoire Lagrange Observatoire de la Côte d’AzurFrantz. He was responsible for the design and construction of the first few generations of SCExAO. He pioneered the electrical/signal distribution system for the instrument and wrote the control software to automate the various functions of the instrument. His greatest contribution however, is the development of the speckle nulling routine which promises and order of magnitude reduction on the brightness of the qausi-static speckles around the post coronagraphic PSF. He is currently implementing his focal plane wavefront sensing method which relies on kernel phase analysis to the instrument. </font></td>

He was responsible for the design and successful rebuild of the SCExAO instrument in 2013 which included upgrading to the 2000 element deformable mirror and reflective rather than refractive relay optics. He works on mechanical design, optical alignment, software implementation as well as management aspects of the project. Nemanja is currently investigating the possibility of utilizing the extreme adaptive optics for injecting into photonic components in order to design new and innovative instruments. </font></td>

				<h2>Visiting members</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>
				Dr Jun-Ichi Morino is a frequent visitor and contributor to the SCExAO project. He has been contributing to the project since ~2010. Most recently Jun-Ichi helped develop low and high level software algorithms for the December 2013 observing run.
				</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Hosted students</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Nour Skaf, </li>	
				<br>
				<li>Vincent Garrel, student at Observatoire de Paris (France), completed his PhD within the SCExAO team in 2012. He focused on the possible uses of a photon-counting camera both for science (lucky imaging) and for wavefront sensing (non-linear curvature wavefront sensor). Vincent was also part of the Subaru AO team and lead the crew of spotters for LGS AO runs.</li><br>
				<li>Sebastien Vievard, an undergraduate student from Observatoire de Paris worked with the SCExAO team on a 6 month internship over the summer of 2013. Sebastien was influential in getting the FIRST instrument setup at Subaru and interfaced with SCExAO. He lead the alignment and testing of that module during his time.</li><br>
				<li>Nicolas Parot, an undergraduate student visited us for a 3 month internship in the summer of 2013. He looked into appropriate disk targets for SCExAO and helped with the rebuild.</li><br>
				<li>Tyler Groff, visited the SCExAO group several times during his PhD to help with the design and assembly of the early version of the instrument. He was critical to early observing runs and is the PI of a shaped pupil coronagraph currently installed within SCExAO. He worked on the SCExAO instrument throughout 2009-2012 and is now an on-going collaborator via the CHARIS integral field spectrograph project.</li><br>
				<li>Paul Stewart, a graduate student from the University of Sydney visited the SCExAO team in 2011 and 2012. He worked on implementing the dual level (visible and IR) benches in SCExAO for the first time. He is currently involved with the visitor module VAMPIRES.</li><br>
				<li>Takashi Yoshikawa, graduate student at the University of Tokyo (Japan), worked with the SCExAO group over the winter of 2009/2010. Takashi majored in space engineering and his focus was on attitude determination and control of spacecrafts. He contributed to the micro-satellite projects PRISM and Nano-JASMINE. During his stay he learnt about AO techniques and in particular phase diversity, to apply some of the tricks to space telescopes.</li><br>
				<li>Kaito Yokochi, graduate student at the University of Tokyo (Japan), also visited over the winter of 2009/2010, to learn about the PIAA and help with the integration of an early version of SCExAO. His experience in interferometry and wavefront sensing techniques made him a great asset to our team. Kaito also explores ways to implement other coronagraphs like the 8OPM and UNI-PAC to SCExAO.</li><br>
				<li>Frederic Vogt from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (Switzerland)  worked with the SCExAO team in 2009 on the design and implementation of the Coronagraphic Low-Order Wavefront Sensor.</li><br>
				<li>Gaetano Sivo, Master's student from Universite de Paris-Sud XI, contributed to the opto-mechanical design of the SCExAO bench and set up an alignment procedure for the different elements of the coronagraph in 2009.</li><br>
				<li> Julien Lozi, an undergraduate student worked on the characterization of the first PIAA lenses in addition to the alignment of the SCExAO instrument in 2008 during a 6 month internship.</li><br>
