<tr>
<td><font face="Trebuchet MS"> <a href="http://frantzmartinache.eu/"><b><i>Dr. Frantz Martinache</i></b></a> is a founding member of the SCExAO project. Currently he holds a position as a assistant professor at Laboratoire Lagrange Observatoire de la Côte d’AzurFrantz. He was responsible for the design and construction of the first few generations of SCExAO. He pioneered the electrical/signal distribution system for the instrument and wrote the control software to automate the various functions of the instrument. His greatest contribution however, is the development of the speckle nulling routine which promises and order of magnitude reduction on the brightness of the qausi-static speckles around the post coronagraphic PSF. He is currently implementing his focal plane wavefront sensing method which relies on kernel phase analysis to the instrument. </font></td>

Currently he holds a position as a Senior Instrument Scientist at Caltech Optical Observatories, California Institute of Technology. He was responsible for the design and successful 2013 and 2016 SCExAO instrument rebuilds, which included upgrading to the 2000 element deformable mirror and reflective rather than refractive relay optics (2013), and simultaneous feed of feed CHARIS, MEC, SAPHIRA and GLINT (2016). He demonstrated the efficient injection of star light from an ExAO system to a single mode fiber and the subsequent use of a photonic spectrograph to characterize the target
