	<h2>The Vector Vortex team</h3>
	<p>
	The vector vortex coronagraph is being developed in collaboration with a team from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories. It is led by Eugene Serabyn and the lead postdoc is Jonas Kuhn. The following publications offer insightful information about this module:

	<h2>The COCORO team (8OPM project)</h3>
	<p>
	The Coronagraphic Observations with Central-Obscuration Removal Optics (COCORO) project is being pursued as a collaboration between multiple institutes, led by Naoshi Murakami from Hokkaido University, Japan. Key team members include Fumika Oshiyama (Hokkaido Univ.), the SCExAO team, Naoshi Baba (Hokkaido Univ.), Taro Matsuo (Kyoto Univ.), Jun Nishikawa (NAOJ), and Motohide Tamura (Univ. Tokyo). The word "COCORO" means "heart" in Japanese.
	</p>
	<p>
	This project is motivated by the fact that focal-plane phase-mask coronagraphs theoretically realize perfect rejection of light from a point-like star under ideal conditions (i.e., perfect incoming stellar wavefront without phase aberrations/diffraction affects). However, the coronagraphic performance degrades due to the presence of a secondary mirror and spiders which induce diffraction affects causing residual stellar light to make its way to the detector and potentially mask the presence of a planet (left figure).

	<p>
	To recover some of the coronagraphic performance, we propose using pupil mapping optics called central-obscuration removal plates (CRPs). The CRPs are a pair of convex-concave plates specially designed for converting a centrally-obscured pupil into a clear circular one. The CRPs are made of low-dispersion calcium fluoride (right figure). We also manufactured an eight-octant phase mask (8OPM), one type of focal-plane phase mask, based on photonic-crystal technology. The CRPs and the 8OPM are both optimized for observations in the H band. The manufactured CRPs and 8OPM have been installed into the SCExAO in Sept 2013. The CRP system would be also useful for other types of focal-plane coronagraphic masks, such as a 4-quadrant phase mask (4QPM) and vector vortex mask.
