<h1>Data Analysis: CHARIS</h1>

<h2>Data Cube Extraction</h2>

<p>The CHARIS data reduction pipeline (DRP) performs an extraction of the raw CHARIS data cube. Some limited image processing steps after extraction of the raw CHARIS data cube are also included.  Please contact T. Brandt for details.</p>

<h2>Spectrophotometric Calibration/Image Registration</h2>

<p>Four satellite spots enable both subpixel image registration and spectrophotometric calibration.   The spots are produced by a sine wave modulation of the SCExAO DM. Current estimates on spectrophotometric precision is ~5% in low-res mode for typical satellite spot brightnesses.</p>
 
<h2>Post-Cube Data Reduction</h2>
Please contact T. Currie for information on Image processing steps after the creation of CHARIS data cubes â€“ registration/calibration, PSF subtraction, and spectral extraction.


<h1>Data Analysis: VAMPIRES</h1>

Please contact B. Norris / VAMPIRES team for data reduction.


<h1>Data analysis R&D</h1>

<p>We support research in extreme-AO and data reduction (predictive control, sensor fusion, optimal image processing). We are happy to share our existing data sets, or work with you to take additional data in support of these activities. Contact SCExAO team for more details.</p>
