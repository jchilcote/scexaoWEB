<h1>Using SCExAO as a Testbed for Technology Development</h1>
<hr>

SCExAO also serves as a testbed for technology development. Its internal broadband light source allows daytime operation.


<h2>Raw Contrast Level and Contrast Stability</h2>

<p>The SCExAO testbed offers ~1e-6 raw contrast and ~1e-8 contrast stability. The raw contrast is function of the coronagraph mode, spectral bandwidth and speckle control mode. Contrast stability can be improved by running active wavefront control loop(s).</p>

<h2>Advanced Wavefront Control R&D</h2>

<p>We support various WFS/C research activities. Contact us if you would like to run WFS/C algorithms on the testbed.</p>

<p>Users can communicate with the DM and cameras using file interface (slow), python scripts (up to ~kHz frame rate) or C libraries (multiple kHz frame rate, low latency). We provide full telemetry to disk, with ~10 microsec time resolution across all cameras.</p>
