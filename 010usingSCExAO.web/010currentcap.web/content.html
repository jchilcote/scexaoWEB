<p>
  The SCExAO instrument is continuously growing and is therefore being commissioned in phases. As of February 2017 phases I & II of engineering have been completed. These include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><em><b>Extreme adaptive optics:</b></em>The pyramid wavefront sensor is now capable of offering 70-85% Strehl ratio in H-band in median seeing conditions. </li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Coronagraphs:</b></em> The SCExAO instrument is equipped with several coronagraphs, which operate across the near-IR (y-K bands). Those that can be used in S17B include the Phase induced amplitude apodization (PIAA), the Vector Vortex and a traditional Lyot coronagraph. Currently the PIAA and vector vortex are only optimized for H-band. New, broadband coronagraphs are being developed and should be available in the not to distant future.</li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Low order control:</b></em> The low order wavefront sensor (LOWFS) is used to fine-tune the tip/tilt and other low order modes (focus, astigmatism, etc) at the coronagraphic mask to ensure optimum starlight rejection.</li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Coherent differential imaging:</b></em> The speckle nulling routine allows for bright quasi-static speckles due to diffraction from the spiders and the central obstruction, to be reduced. The performance of this mode is limited by the current generation of cameras but it allows for a dark hole to be dug on one side of the PSF and improves companion detectability (See below).</li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Astrometry and photometry:</b></em> A grid of artificial speckles can be created with a precisely calibrated amplitude that can be used to calibrate the photometry and astrometry to the companion. The speckles are created by the deformable mirror and can be placed at any location/orientation (within the control region of the DM) in the focal plane. Their brightness can also be controlled. This enables astrometry behind the coronagraph and offers a unique avenue to contrast calibration.</li>

  <br>
  <li><em><b>Integral field spectroscopy:</b></em> CHARIS offers the possibility to obtain low resolution spectra (R~20 or 80) across a 2” field behind SCExAO. All observing modes of CHARIS can be used with all other modes described above. Full details of CHARIS can be found <a href='http://scholar.princeton.edu/charis'><i>here</i></a>.</li>
  <br>	
  <li><em><b>VAMPIRES:</b></em> The VAMPIRES interferometric imager will enable diffraction-limited imaging in the visible with polarimetric capabilities. The performance and observational setting options are listed below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cameras</h3>
  <p>
  Speckle nulling is performed with the camera used for high frame rate imaging. This camera is the same as the one used for the LOWFS. They are both Axiom Optics OWL SW1.7HS units, which have an InGaAs CMOS array with 320x256 pixels that are 30x30 &mu;m in size. These cameras can run full frame at 176 Hz and have a read noise of 115 and 140 e<sup>-</sup> respectively. The dark current is such that the maximum exposure is ~1 s. Please note that the speckle nulling routine operates on the speckles which are ~1000 x fainter than the central PSF and hence this must be taken into consideration when selecting your target, in light of the noise characteristics. A speckle nulling map can be pre-carved off sky and then applied on-sky in the case targets are too faint to operate speckle nulling on. However, this is not as accurate as performing the nulling process on the star of interest. The high frame rate/speckle nulling camera can be used with a series of bandpass filters which include: y-band, J-band, H-band and 50 nm bandwidth centered at 1650 nm.

  <h3>Calibration source</h3>
  <p>
  The internal calibration source consists of a Fianium super continuum source and 2 laser diodes centered at 650 and 1550 nm. The light from the source is delivered via an endlessely single-mode fiber to the bench ensuring a diffraction-limited calibration PSF from the visible to K-band. The brightness and spectral bands of the injected light can be easily controlled. In addition there is a turbulence simulator that can be used for realistic simulations of on-sky performance in the laboratory.
