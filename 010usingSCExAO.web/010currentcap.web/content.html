<p>This document describes SCExAO capabilities commissionned as of Aug 2018. S19A proposers can use this page as a guide to prepare their proposals.</p>

<p>More advanced operation modes that have not yet been commissioned are NOT described in this page, and may be available to observers (please check with SCExAO development team for readiness level and relevance to your observations).</p>

<h2>Cameras</h2>

<h3>Prime Science Cameras</h3>
SCExAO can feed the CHARIS and VAMPIRES instruments:
<ul>
<li>CHARIS provides <b>near-IR Integral field spectroscopy</b> at spectral resolution ranging from R=20 to R=70 across a 2" field of view. For more details, see <a href="../../030charis.web/indexm.html">CHARIS page</a>.</li>
<li>VAMPIRES provides <b>diffraction-limited visible light imaging, polarimetry and interferometry</b>. For more details see <a href="../../040vampires.web/indexm.html">VAMPIRES page</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Internal Cameras</h3>
Speckle nulling is performed with the camera used for high frame rate imaging. This camera is the same as the one used for the LOWFS. They are both Axiom Optics OWL SW1.7HS units, which have an InGaAs CMOS array with 320x256 pixels that are 30x30 &mu;m in size. These cameras can run full frame at 176 Hz and have a read noise of 115 and 140 e<sup>-</sup> respectively. The dark current is such that the maximum exposure is ~1 s. Please note that the speckle nulling routine operates on the speckles which are ~1000 x fainter than the central PSF and hence this must be taken into consideration when selecting your target, in light of the noise characteristics. A speckle nulling map can be pre-carved off sky and then applied on-sky in the case targets are too faint to operate speckle nulling on. However, this is not as accurate as performing the nulling process on the star of interest. The high frame rate/speckle nulling camera can be used with a series of bandpass filters which include: y-band, J-band, H-band and 50 nm bandwidth centered at 1650 nm.

<h2>Wavefront Correction</h2>

<h3>Pyramid WFS</h3>
SCExAO's main wavefront sensor is a pyramid wavefront sensor (pyWFS), driving a 2000-actuator deformable mirror (DM). The PyWFS control loop offers 70-90% Strehl ratio in H-band in median seeing conditions. On-sky performance varies according to seeing, wind speed, and guide star magnitude. Wavefront sensing is performed in visible-to-nearIR light (from 600nm to 900nm).

<h3>Coronagraphic Low-Order WFS</h3>
Starlight blocked by the Coronagraph may be directed to a coronagraphic Low-Order Wavefront Sensor (CLOWFS), which keeps the star well-centered on the coronagraph mask. This mode is available with the PIAACMC and VORTEX coronagraph modes to ensure optimum starlight rejection.

<h3>Speckle Nulling</h3>
We offer a static speckle nulling observation mode, where a DM map is computed to create a half dark hole, and the wavefront control loop is then locking the wavefront around this new offset. This mode provides a ~2x improvement in raw contrast over one half of the field of view, but extra light (>2x) is injected on the opposite side.



<h2>Coronagraphs</h2>

<h3>List of Available Coronagraphs</h3>
The SCExAO instrument is equipped with several coronagraphs, which operate across the near-IR (y-K bands) :
<ul>
<li>The Phase induced amplitude apodization complex mask coronagraph (PIAACMC) provides small IWA and high throuput in H band</li>
<li>The Vortex coronagraph provides small IWA and high throuput in H band</li>
<li>The Lyot coronagraphs provide high throughput, robust performance across the near-IR (y-K bands)</li>
<li>The Shaped Pupil coronagraph provides robust performance across the near-IR (y-K bands)</li>
</ul>





<h2>Contrast Performance</h2>



<h2>Astrometry and Photometry</h2>

A grid of artificial speckles can be created with a precisely calibrated amplitude that can be used to calibrate the photometry and astrometry to the companion. The speckles are created by the deformable mirror and can be placed at any location/orientation (within the control region of the DM) in the focal plane. Their brightness can also be controlled. This enables astrometry behind the coronagraph and offers a unique avenue to contrast calibration.




<h2>Calibration source</h2>
 
The internal calibration source consists of a Fianium super continuum source and 2 laser diodes centered at 650 and 1550 nm. The light from the source is delivered via an endlessely single-mode fiber to the bench ensuring a diffraction-limited calibration PSF from the visible to K-band. The brightness and spectral bands of the injected light can be easily controlled. In addition there is a turbulence simulator that can be used for realistic simulations of on-sky performance in the laboratory.
