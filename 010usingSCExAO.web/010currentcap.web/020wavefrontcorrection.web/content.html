<h1>Wavefront Correction</h1>

<h2>Facility AO correction (AO188)</h2>

<p>SCExAO is a booster stage for the initial AO correction provided by AO188. The table below summarizes the performance and key parameters required when putting together a proposal. </p>

<h2>ExAO primary correction (Pyramid WFS)</h2>
<p>SCExAO's main wavefront sensor is a pyramid wavefront sensor (pyWFS), driving a 2000-actuator deformable mirror (DM). The PyWFS control loop offers 70-90% Strehl ratio in H-band in median seeing conditions. On-sky performance varies according to seeing, wind speed, and guide star magnitude. Wavefront sensing is performed in visible-to-nearIR light (from 600nm to 900nm).</p>

<h2>Coronagraphic Low-Order WFS</h2>
Starlight blocked by the Coronagraph may be directed to a coronagraphic Low-Order Wavefront Sensor (CLOWFS), which keeps the star well-centered on the coronagraph mask. This mode is available with the PIAACMC and VORTEX coronagraph modes to ensure optimum starlight rejection.

<h2>Speckle Control</h2>
We offer a static speckle nulling observation mode, where a DM map is computed to create a half dark hole, and the wavefront control loop is then locking the wavefront around this new offset. This mode provides a ~2x improvement in raw contrast over one half of the field of view, but extra light (>2x) is injected on the opposite side.

A speckle nulling map can be pre-carved off sky and then applied on-sky in the case targets are too faint to operate speckle nulling on. However, this is not as accurate as performing the nulling process on the star of interest
