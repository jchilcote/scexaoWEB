<h2>SCExAO as a science instrument</h2>

If using SCExAO as a science instrument, check our <a href="./010currentcap.web/indexm.html">current capabilities</a> available to science observers. See also <a href="./020openuse.web/indexm.html">open use</a> section to request time and prepare observations.


<h2>SCExAO as a testbed for technology development</h2>

We provide access to SCExAO for R&D in high contrast imaging and extreme-AO. See <a href="./030techdev.web/indexm.html">testbed</a> description for more details. You can run experiments on the testbed, including hardware testing.


<h2>Data Analysis</h2>

We acquire data sets used by high contrast imaging scientists and engineers to help crack some of the most challenging challenges, including predictive control and real-time data calibration. See the <a href="./040dataanalysis.web/indexm.html">data analysis page</a> for more details.
