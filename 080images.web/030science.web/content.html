The low-mass companion kappa And b is easily visible in raw CHARIS data and detected at SNR > 175 in 14 minutes of integration time.   Its spectrum may provide new constraints on its gravity (and, in turn, its mass).<br>

CHARIS data for another debris disk provides some evidence for a hitherto unseen brightness asymmetry.   Spatially-resolved spectra available with CHARIS can constrain the dust composition of these and other debris disks.<br>
