<h2> 2018-09-05 pseudo-open-loop pyramid WFS coefficients</h2>


<p>PyWFS pseudo-open-loop coefficients, recorded at 3 kHz and 2 kHz. Each time sample has 1111 values correspongind to 1111 wavefront modes.</p>

<p>See observing <a href="https://www.naoj.hawaii.edu/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905/notes.txt">notes</a> for more details and times.</p>

<h2> 2018-06-05 Simultaneous PyWFS - vcamim0 images </h2>

This dataset consists of pyramid WFS images (aol0_wfsim) and visible light focal plane images (vcamim). Both streams have been re-sampled to the same time sequence, compensating for hardware lag and different frame rates. The resampled data has 147,965 frames, at a temporal frame rate of 500 Hz.

</ul>

The goal of this dataset is to explore if/how focal plane images can be reconstructed from WFS telemetry. Note that about 3% of the time samples are missing, so do not assume that time is simply proportional to frame index.

<p>Files come in pair. FITS files are 3D cubes, with the 3rd axis representing time/sample. Timing files (.dat or .txt) provide the time for each sample. Column 4 is the absolute unix time in second (Jan 1, 1970 origin). Files are named per the UT time of the first sample.</p>
