<h2> 2018-09-05 pseudo-open-loop pyramid WFS coefficients</h2>

PyWFS pseudo-open-loop coefficients, recorded at 3 kHz and 2 kHz. Each time sample has 1111 values correspongind to 1111 wavefront modes.

See observing <a href="https://www.naoj.org/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905/notes.txt">notes</a> for more details and times.

<a href="https://www.naoj.org/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905/DMmodes_2018-09-01_05:43:27.fits"> Wavefront modes</a>, represented on the 50x50 deformable mirror, unit is DM mechanical displacement in micron.

To download files, see the <a href="filelist.txt">file list</a>. All files are in the same directory (https://www.naoj.org/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905). You cannot scan the directory but you can download individual files by adding filename to the directory name, or write a wget script to pull a set of files.
