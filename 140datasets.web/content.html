<h2> 2018-09-05 pseudo-open-loop pyramid WFS coefficients</h2>


<p>PyWFS pseudo-open-loop coefficients, recorded at 3 kHz and 2 kHz. Each time sample has 1111 values correspongind to 1111 wavefront modes.</p>

<p>See observing <a href="https://www.naoj.hawaii.edu/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905/notes.txt">notes</a> for more details and times.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.naoj.hawaii.edu/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905/DMmodes_2018-09-01_05:43:27.fits"> Wavefront modes</a>, represented on the 50x50 deformable mirror, unit is DM mechanical displacement in micron.</p>


<p>To download files, see the <a href="https://www.naoj.hawaii.edu/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905/aol0_modeval_ol/filelist.txt">file list</a>. All files are in the same directory (https://www.naoj.org/Projects/SCEXAO/data/20180905/aol0_modeval_ol). You cannot scan the directory but you can download individual files by adding filename to the directory name, or write a wget script to pull a set of files.</p>

<p>Files come in pair. FITS files are 3D cubes, with the 3rd axis representing time/sample. Timing files (.dat or .txt) provide the time for each sample. Column 4 is the absolute unix time in second (Jan 1, 1970 origin). Files are named per the UT time of the first sample.</p>
