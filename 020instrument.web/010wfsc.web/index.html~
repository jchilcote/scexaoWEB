<h1>High-Order Wavefront Sensor: The Pyramid</h1>

<p>
High-order wavefront sensing and correction is the key
feature of the SCExAO Project. High order wavefront correction, or "extreme AO" requires a deformable mirror with many actuators across the pupil to correct for high spatial frequencies. In addition, it requires the control loop to run much faster than the coherence time of the atmosphere (~1 ms/1 kHz). For this reason we use the Boston MicroMachines 2000 element MEMS-based deformable mirror. For full details about the deformable mirror please see our <a href="../../04publis/02scexao/"> publications</a>.
</p>

<p>
One interesting feature of the DM is that it should not be operated in a high humidity environment as this causes advanced ageing. In order to accommodate this we have developed a dry air supply circuit. This circuit is interlocked such that the DM electronics are shut off if the humidity goes above 15% and or the pressure in the line deviates from the nominal setting of 0.4 psi. Please see this <a href="Instructions_for_gas_supply_unit.pdf"> document</a> for further details about the interlock system.
</p>

<p>
The other major aspect to high order wavefront correction is sensing. For this we utilize a pyramid wavefront sensor. This sensor operates in the visible between 600 and 900 nm. We have recently begun to use a pyramid prism which replaced the micro-lens arrays used in the past. The concept is to place the vertex of the pyramid/micro-lens array in the focal plane to create 4 distinct images of the pupil from each sector of the focal plane image. As each pupil image does not have all the Fourier information from the entire PSF, phase errors manifest as amplitude errors which are detectable by the sensor. 
</p>
<p>
Since it is quite difficult to obtain a pyramidal optic we chose a non-traditional approach to build our PyWFS. The concept we use utilizes two roof prisms oriented so that the roof vertices are orthogonal to one another (one is horizontal and the other is vertical). This concept is shown on the Figure below, on the right.
</p>

<p><small>Left: Schematic of the roof prism pyramid optic concept ; Right: Roof prism assembly diffracting a collimated beam into 4 beamlets.</small></p>
</center>
<p>
The space between the vertices is very small (20-50 &microm) and as close as possible to the focus of the beam to minimize the affect of diffraction. The assembly can be seen on the right of the above figure, before installation in SCExAO.
</p>
<p>
Images of the 4 pupils (see below)) are then acquired by a photon counting EMCCD (OCAM2k - FirstLight Imaging) with a 3.5 kHz binned frame rate, negligible latency and a 0.3e- read-out noise at a gain of 600x.

<h2>New approach: pyramid prism and OCAM2k</h2>
<p>
We determined that the PyWFS’s performance was being limited by hardware. Hence we undertook a number of hardware upgrades prior to the November run. These included
</p>
<ul>
<li>A photon counting EMCCD (OCAM2k – FirstLight Imaging): binned frame rate = 3.5 kHz, negligible latency, 0.3 e- read-out noise at a gain of 600x.</li><br>
<li>A fast tip/tilt mount to modulate the pyramid response: can be run up to 10 kHz but amplitude of modulation drops off at higher frequency.</li><br>
<li>A pyramid optic: The pyramid optic was leant to us by MagAO (Laird Close and Jared Males). The optic consists of two pyramid-shaped optics back-to-back. The apex and vertices at the interface of the sides of the pyramid are extremely precise (less than 5 μm wide), which minimizes the affect of diffraction. The pyramid optic was needed as we determined micro-lenses were not ideal. Small micro-lenses had low diffraction but had a limited field of view, which meant it was not possible to modulate with them. Large micro-lenses allowed for modulation but the edge quality was poor, which lead to very high diffraction effects.</li><br>
</ul>

An image of the 4 pupils with the new optics is shown in the figure.

<p>
Highlights of the key results to come from the November 2014 run:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The PyWFS worked on-sky on a limited number of modes (up to 14) improving the PSF stability for science observations. </li><br>
<li>After many days of experimenting, a robust approach to operating the PyWFS was determined. The PyWFS loop was closed on the internal laser source (with realistic turbulence, similar to post AO188 values) on up to 1030 modes! HiCAIO images with the loop open and closed clearly show the improvement in the PSF/speckle quality. The Strehl ratio improved from 23% to >90% on average. This indicates that the PyWFS will be able to take a post AO188 quality PSF and improve the Strehl to ~90% as designed in future!</li><br>
</ul>
