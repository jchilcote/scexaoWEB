<h2>PIAA: designed to apodize a centrally obstructed beam</h2>

The Phase Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) uses a set of two
tailored optics working as a pair: inserted in a collimated beam, the
first changes the distribution of light, while the second recollimates
the beam for an on-axis source. This concept has already been the
subject of multiple <a href="../../04publis/02scexao/">publications</a>.
One novelty of the Subaru PIAA Coronagraph is that its design is
adapted to the presence of a central obscuration.
</p>

<p>
The advantages of this approach over what is usually referred to as
"classical" apodization is that instead of being absorbed by a mask
with a radial transmission profile, the light gets redistributed. This preserves the throughput (which can be as low as
0.1 for a 10<sup>-10</sup> contrast), and the angular resolution
(indeed, a classical apodizing mask removes the light mostly at the
edges of the pupil).
</p>

<p>
The picture at the top of this page shows a visible collimated laser
beam being apodized by the PIAA. The set of lenses leaves the pupil
diameter unchanged. As the light travels from left to right in the
picture, the beam gets apodized and the central obscuration gradually
disappears.
</p>
<p>
A low dispersion material was chosen (CaF<sub>2</sub>) to keep
chromatic aberrations small. Unlike off-axis reflective systems, this
refractive set of optics with circular symmetry are fairly easy to
manufacture.
